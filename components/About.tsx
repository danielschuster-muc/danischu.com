            <p className="mb-3 font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-300">
              I am currently studying Computer Science with a minor in Business Administration at
              Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t in Munich. <br />
              I have been passionate about technology and programming for a long time. I have always
              loved creating things and started my &quot;programming career&quot; with making small
              websites, Minecraft modifications and Discord bots. <br />
              After graduating from high school in July 2021, I participated in a web development
              bootcamp at Le Wagon Munich. It was a very intensive and interesting time where I
              learned a lot about web development. Afterwards I did a 6-week software internship at
              QAware GmbH, where I could peek into the work of professional programming. <br />
              During the gap between school and start of University I also went to a language course
              to Valencia, Spain, and worked for a startup, where I was responsible for developing
              the database and website. <br />
              Overall it has been an exciting journey so far for me and I am excited to continue my
              studies and see where my career takes me.
