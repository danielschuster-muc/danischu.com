            <p className="mb-3 font-normal text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-300">
              I have been studying Computer Science with a minor in Business Administration at
              Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t in Munich since October 2022. In addition, I am also
              active member of the student initiative Enactus M√ºnchen e.V. in the Techdalo project,
              which helps Colombian school graduates finding a job in IT. <br />
              Already during school I discovered my interest in programming, created my first small
              websites, developed Minecraft modifications and programmed Discord bots.
              <br />
              After graduating from high school in July 2021, I participated in a web development
              bootcamp at Le Wagon Munich. It was a very intensive and exciting time, in which I
              dived deep into web development. Afterwards I did a 6-week software internship at
              QAware GmbH, where I could peek into the work of professional programming during a
              project for a large german car manufacturer. My tasks included the creation of web
              components to display check control messages and the setup of automated UI tests.
              <br />
              Afterwards, I worked as a freelancer for 2 months to support the development of a
              start-up in the field of &quot;workation as a service&quot; and mainly took care of
              database setup and data model creation & validation. Until the start of my studies I
              was helping out at the M√ºnchner Tafel.
